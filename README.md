CASH Music UX planning

UX plans, mock-ups, and sketches â€” used for platform buildout. Most of the planning 
starts on paper the moves to quick prototypes, or occasionally turns into a mockup if 
the prototype is too hard. 

This repo is here to collect all of those sketches and mockups so they're not lost, and 
so it can serve as a template for our next steps. 

Yeah we should probably find something nicer than bad drawings.
